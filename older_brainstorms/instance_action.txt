Until now, I thought I would have one 'actions' table
and then the 'action_intervals' table for the stopwatch style tracking.
The actions table would contain all the planning and record aspects of the action.

But ChatGPT lead me to an idea: what if we make the actions timeless entities,
just a concept of an action. Not tied to any real world happening.
Just like a contact in a contact book. Then we can have instances
of those actions. The only benefit I see at the moment, is for example
wanting to see the history of all the times I have done the action
'Work at REI' and want to see how much time total, what days, etc.
It could also help with not reconnecting the action to a higher part
of the path like a 'why enity' or a project or a higher project.
But I am stil not sure if it is worth it or if I should only create
a new row for an action when it is a real planned or recorded thing.


I believe the timeless action work best with the seperate 'action_instance' table.
If I wanted to see how much time I spent on washing clothes this week, it would
have to be a string matching search for the action name
which could have been entered fiferently every time.
actions table should be timeless, the 'profile' of the action.


Timeless action phiosophy:

Consider the action "Clean backyard"
That can be a timeless action, which has description, connected to either a project
or vision item. That wont change with the different instances, it is the same 
action. And then, once we plan to actually do it tomorrow, we create an instance of it.
That instance has a date which is tomorrow, potentially a planned duration
and planned start/end times. 


I am thinking that actually, instead of splitting something like sleep
into two parts because of midnight, I make the action instance itself
actually once peice, its just that the hours that it contributes to the
days 24 measurement are split between the two days.
