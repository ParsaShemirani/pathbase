Without any time management, we have one bucket called 'Unrecorded'
and the hose of water. The hose is just pouring straight into the unrecorded bucket.

I decide I want to clean my room, so I put a new bucket called 'clean room'
in the field. Now, whenever I feel like it, I can switch the hose over to the
clean room bucket, until it is full. At this point, both buckets are auto expanding.
They start with zero volume, and have the potential to get infinetly big as
water is poured into them. Once I clean my room, I put the hose back in the
'unrecorded' bucket.

Through the examples, the water in the hose is like time, and it going
into a bucket represents spending that time on the action.

I think of more things I want to do such as 'Call Jake' and 
'cook lunch' and 'wash clothes', each getting a bucket.
These are all just things I wish to do, and i can switch to any of them
whenever I want to.

- We have a bunch of accumilating buckets and its getting out of control
- If I want to make a new bucket for the action I already did, now
I have two buckets for the same action, it becomes unclear which is which.

Two approaches to proceed:
- Seperate the buckets by a certain repeating time frame, such
as a day
- Archive the buckets that are done.
