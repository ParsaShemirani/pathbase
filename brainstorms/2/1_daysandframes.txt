Pure UTC way:
Everything UTC based. The 24 hour 'Day' period is always from
00:00 UTC of the day to 23:59.99 UTC of the day.
Times in the app will be displayed as the local date and timezone
of the user, but the 'time frame' of the day will
be from 7AM to 6:56AM. This way, if the user travels
to another timezone, only the top layer of UTC -> Local time
conversion happens for the timestamps. The durations,
stopwatches, day's total remains unchanged.

However, one must translate their dad saying 'Clean backyard by Sunday'
to one of the UTC 24 hour timeframes. 

Consideration: The new day (00:00 local time) anywhere in the word
is likely to be sleeping time, whereas the new day in UTC may be in
the middle of class or a meeting, so one must split the duration between those days.
