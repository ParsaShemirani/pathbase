What if instead of creating a timeframe of 24 hours,
we instead make it like a moving frame in time.
So we have points where we are supposed to have finished an action
that has a duration to it. And the frame will always be the next
24 hours, and will consider every action that needs to be done within that time.
And that moving frame winodw can be adjusted to the next X amount of time,
and the math will all translate. And I can schedule timeframes
whenever I want, and that will block the available time of the rolling window.

I think ill try building it and see how it rolls out for now.
