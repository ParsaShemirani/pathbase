Scheduled | Unscheduled view of time. Starts with 24 hours unscheduled,
as tasks are added with target time, that time goes towards scheduled.
Two matters: Scheduling target times, and recording what happened.
Goal: avoid unrecorded time as much as possible. I can have 24 hours unscheduled,
but record most of the day. That is done via stopwatches with no target time.
Target time means scheduled, going in it with a plan. No target time
means we are doing something with no planned out time amount to do it,
and just recording what happens. Question: should I tolerate going above
the target time?
