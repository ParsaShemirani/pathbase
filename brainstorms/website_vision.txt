I want to start with a website that allows for the recording
features. Since every segment is tied to an action, we need
to be able to create actions, aswell as view the ones that
already exist. On the main page, it will display
the current running segment with its elapsed time, action id,
segment id, and action name. There will be links
at the bottom of the page which open up pages
for the 10 most recent segments, as well as a page which loads
the entire history of all the segments. There will be a page
that is an action manager. It allows me to view and add them.
There are two fields at the top, one to search for an action,
and one to add a new action. Below those two fields, there is
also a button for 'all actions'. If a search is made for an action,
it opens a new page which is just a list of the relevant actions
and their ids. If an action is added, it opens a new page that says
action added and shows the new action with its id. 


Main page:
- Segment manager
- Action manager

Segment manager:
- Shows running segment + info
- Button to stop current action if running
- If no running action, field to start new segment
- Two buttons, one showing last 10 segments,
one showing segment sums for the display

Action manager:
- Shows running action + info
- Field to create a new action with name (Opens new page shows id and name)
- Field to search for an action (opens new results page)
- Button to show all actions ordered by id
