I will start the frames in the following matter:

Define a 'time_frame' class, they cannot overlap, but a time frame can be a child
of another time frame.

Plans are tied to time frames, action segments are tied to actions.
So an action segment can be recorded without a time frame or ActionPlan
that accompanies it.
