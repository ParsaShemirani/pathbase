Now that I have the stopwatches.py first functions,
I want to see the 'moving 24 hour frame' in action
to see if it is the best way forward.

Decisions:
Are action segments just tied to actions or
action plans?
 
Will I have multiple 'end time' points in time,
each of which can be selected and viewed, or will it always
just roll as now -> 24 hours from now?
