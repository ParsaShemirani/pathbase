Action: Duration based
Event: Start/end timestamp based.

Scenario:

"Tonight, I'm planning to sleep from 9 PM to 5 PM".

Implementation:
Event: Sleep | Start: 2025-08-19 21:00:00.00 | End: 2025-08-19 23:59:59.99
Event: Sleep | Start: 2025-08-20 00:00:00.00 | End: 2025-08-19 05:00:00.00

Scheduled Action: Sleep | Date: 2025-08-19 | Duration: 03:59:59.99
Scheduled Action: Sleep | Date: 2025-08-20 | Duration: 05:00:00.00


Then, on the 19th, we can start the stopwatch for 'sleep' when I am heading for bed,
and we set tomorrows scheduled 'sleep' stopwatch to be the one that starts
when the new day starts.

Thought: Should the scheduled action and the recorded kind of action be seperate or rather
one row in the database with different columns, scheduled_duration | recorded_duration

Idea: scheduled_duration | recorded_duration

scheduled_duration | actual_duration Potentially?


Scenario:

"I plan to read sample book 1 for 30 minutes tomorrow"

Implementation:
Scheduled Action: Read sample book 1 | Date: 2025-08-20 | Duration: 00:30:00.00

Then, on the 20th, throught he day I may pick up the book, each time switching
the active stopwatch to the 'Read sample book 1' stopwatch. And at the end of the day,
it will save that 'recorded' value of time which I actually spent on it.

Scenario:
"My friend James said there is a gathering at his house from 5PM to 10PM on august 28th.
I only want to stay for 2 hours or so and then leave. So I will plan to be there
from 5 to 7 pm."

Implementation:
Event: Gathering at James's house | Start: 2025-08-28 17:00:00.00 | End: 2025-08-28 19:00:00.00

Scheduled action: Gathering at James's house | Date: 2025-08-28 | Duration: 02:00:00.00

Notes for above scenario:
Even though the actual event is planned for 5 to 10, the 'event' in My
system is only for when I am planning to be involved with the event, when I want to be there,
and the duration on the scheduled action is also as such.

Scenario:
"I need to get from my house to the gathering at James's house on August 28th."

Implementation:
Event: Drive to James's house | Start: 2025-08-28 16:30:00.00 | End: 2025-08-28 16:50:00.00

Scheduled action: Drive to James's house | Date: 2025-08-28 | Duration: 00:20:00.00

Notes for above scenario:
We want to arrive 10 minutes early to ensure we are on time. But we expect the drive to only
be 20 minutes. Since the duration is only 20 minutes, when we start it at 4:30 when we start
driving, there are two scenarios. First scenario is that we arrive on time within 20 minutes.
We then open the app to stop the stopwatch, as we are done driving. But we realize,
that we cannot stop the stopwatch. We can only switch it, as per the app philosophy. So we still
have 10 minutes before the event, and we can look at the scheduled actions and switch to something like
'Read sample book one' and make some progress on that. Or we can switch to 'unrecorded' which is the worst
case scenario, we are trying to avoid unrecorded as much as possible but it is definetly permissible and
part of the process, it allows flexibility. Or we can Create a new stopwatch that says something like
"Check whatsapp messages" and do that until we switch to the James's gathering stopwatch. This way,
we still record the actual thing I spent my time on during that window of time.

The second possibilty is that there is traffic and it takes longer than scheduled. It took 27 minutes to arrive.
We can then switch to another stopwatch since we are done driving. Its only three minutes until the Scheduled
event so we might just put it to unrecorded stopwatch for the time, and then switch to the 'James's gathering'
stopwatch in three minutes.
