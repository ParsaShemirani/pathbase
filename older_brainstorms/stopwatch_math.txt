Scheduled | Unscheduled view of time. Starts with 24 hours unscheduled,
as tasks are added with target time, that time goes towards scheduled.
Two matters: Scheduling target times, and recording what happened.
Goal: avoid unrecorded time as much as possible. I can have 24 hours unscheduled,
but record most of the day. That is done via stopwatches with no target time.
Target time means scheduled, going in it with a plan. No target time
means we are doing something with no planned out time amount to do it,
and just recording what happens. Question: should I tolerate going above
the target time? 

Approach: Start as just a recorder, then add scheudling/target logic as beneficial. But first start with just recorder logic.

Recorder:
Starts with one "unrecorded" stopwatch, we can add and delete new ones.
From the 'planning' view, we can set the stopwatch which is set to run
when the day starts. Defaults to unrecorded. At the end of the day,
it saves all of the stopwatches to the database, then switches to the
stopwatches for the new day, with the appointed one starting instantly.
There is no 'Stop' or "Pause" button, only option to switch the one
running stopwatch.

Target times:
Why would I even add target times? Mainly for planning, I want to see 
how much the tasks I have already assigned will take, and how much
unscheduled time remains.
