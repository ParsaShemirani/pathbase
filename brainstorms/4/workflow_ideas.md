## So far
So far I have just been using the aciton segments which record a name, start time, and end time. I am stil thinking the goal is to have concrete actions that have ids, and then have these action segemnts refer to those id's so that I can do some concrete analysis. If every action segment has a slightly different name, it is hard to group by that.


Before I get to recording things like intention, I want to just record the time I spend doing specific actions. Some actions like 'pack bed', I dont differenciate between 'put away mattress' and 'put away sleeping bag' and 'put away pillow'. I just bundle them all together. But when I do my morning routine, I dont just record 'morning routine'. I do 'bathroom', 'wudu', 'pray', 'pack bed', etc. Maybe I can subset these actions so some actions are subsets of others.

A big difficulty I have now is wondering how to model actions I do at the same time like riding to work while listening to audiobook.
