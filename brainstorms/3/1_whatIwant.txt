Now that I have the stopwatches.py first functions,
I want to see the 'moving 24 hour frame' in action
to see if it is the best way forward.

Decisions:
Are action segments just tied to actions or
action plans?
 
Will I have multiple 'end time' points in time,
each of which can be selected and viewed, or will it always
just roll as now -> 24 hours from now?


The main idea: thinking somewhere between
a to do list on paper, vs time blocking on the calendar.
Can we add end dates and durations to those to do items
and get valuable guidance without setting them
to a time block, or not even a day? What if with just those two
pieces of information, one can see how much unscheduled time they have,
judge wether or not they can add / extend / not do something.
Ensure that the target amount of time is spent, even though
it was not all in one session.
