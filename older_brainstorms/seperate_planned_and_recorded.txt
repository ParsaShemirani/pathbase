I am considering seperating the logic between
planned and recorded instances of actions.
Both of these seperate entities will reference a 'action',
which is a timeless entity.

One can avoid planning entirely. Once the 'action' entity has been
created, we just switch the running stopwatch to that action.
It then uses the 'interval' style of tracking. So we are recording the reality
in this method. And there is no grouping of these action intervals.
They are all seperate entities. But they reference the same
timeless action. They can go across days, they are not
subsets of a day.

One can plan and avoid recording. We can create planned instances
of actions which again reference a timeless action entity.
the instance can have a window of time which we are planning
to do it within. For example, consider the timeless action
'clean room'. We can plan to do that anywhere from
8 am tomorrow to 10pm in three days. Because as long as it
is done before then, we are alright to do it.

Question: Why would one even bother with a start time then?
At first look, only the end time of the window is of importance
to plan, and the window to do it starts right now, all the time.

Lets consider a scenario:
- Room planned to be cleaned before 9 pm tomorrow.
- Garage planned to be cleaned before 7pm in 10 days.
- Clothes to be washed before 7pm in 10 days.
- Contact james within 20 days from now.

We can record the planned duration that each task should take.
We wait to do garage until the last duration possibilty, but
we havent started clothes washing which has a window that ends
wihtin that same time.
