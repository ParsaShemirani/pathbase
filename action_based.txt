New idea:

Instead of seperate entities like events, actions, planned action,
I will just have action.

An action will be a single entitity.
In a scenario when it is created and recorded in the course
of a day, it will only have the 'recorded_duration' attribute
and of course the date. 

If we planned it from before to spend a certain amount
of time on it, it will have a date and 'planned_duration'
attribtute, and then when the day comes, we will record it
and add the 'recorded_duration' attribute.

If we planeed it from before and it is important to do it
at a certain time in the day, it will have a date,
'time_frame' attribute (or start/end time), and also
a 'planned_duration' attribute. Then the 'recorded_duration'
will be added on the day of.
